# FIPS 140 Compliance

> **IMPORTANT:**  
> This package is *not* itself FIPS 140 validated or certified. See below for details on compatibility and limitations.

## Overview

This package is designed to operate within FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 validated environments, leveraging only the Go standard library cryptographic primitives. No custom or third-party cryptography is used.

## Compatibility with Go FIPS 140 Mode

Go provides a dedicated FIPS 140 mode, enabled with the environment variable `GODEBUG=fips140=on` or `GODEBUG=fips140=1`. When enabled, this mode restricts cryptographic operations to those explicitly permitted under the FIPS 140 standard, and applies additional runtime checks to enforce compliance.

This package is engineered for **full compatibility with Go’s FIPS 140 mode**:

- **All cryptographic operations** use only Go standard library algorithms.
- **No prohibited or non-standard cryptography** is invoked when FIPS mode is active.
- **No inclusion** of third-party or experimental crypto.

When Go’s FIPS 140 mode is active, any use of non-approved cryptography results in a runtime error, providing enforcement at the platform level.

## Important Limitations and Legal Notice

- **This package is not independently validated or certified under FIPS 140 by NIST or any authority.**  
  Operation within a FIPS-validated environment is supported, but this alone does not provide FIPS validation.
- **Go FIPS 140 mode does not grant FIPS 140 validation or certification.**  
  It only enforces approved algorithm use when run with a FIPS-validated Go runtime and platform.
- **Setting `GODEBUG=fips140=on` is enforcement, not certification.**  
  Your responsibility is to ensure the Go runtime, cryptographic libraries, and the OS are all FIPS-validated if you require formal compliance.
- **No warranty or guarantee of FIPS 140 compliance is expressed or implied.**  
  Regulatory compliance is the responsibility of the deploying organization.

## Recommendations for Deploying in FIPS-Regulated Environments

- **Deploy only on FIPS-validated platforms:**  
  Ensure the OS, Go runtime, and underlying crypto modules have valid FIPS 140 certifications.
- **Audit your deployment:**  
  Regularly review your supply chain, build, and deployment process for compliance.
- **Consult compliance and security professionals:**  
  Engage your organization’s legal and compliance teams to ensure your deployment meets all requirements.
- **Retain and review certifications:**  
  For compliance reporting, use only official documentation and certification records.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> Use of this package in FIPS-regulated environments is at your own risk. No warranty, express or implied, is provided regarding FIPS 140 compliance. This package is distributed “as is” and must be reviewed and validated as part of your organization’s own compliance and certification process.
