  # Changelog generation implementation to use.

  # Valid options are:

  # - `gitlab`: uses the compare GitLab API, appending the author name and email to the changelog (requires a personal access token).
  # - `gitea`: uses the compare Gitea API, appending the author username to the changelog.
  # - `github-native`: uses the GitHub release notes generation API, disables the groups feature.

  # Default: 'git'.
